# pytorch-rwa

This project is meant to be a pytorch implementation of the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01253.pdf)

So far I have implemented the forward pass - haven't actually checked to see if it trains
the way we expect it to based on the paper.

TODO:
- [ ] Train the network on tasks in [the original repo](https://github.com/jostmey/rwa)
- [ ] Use this in projects!
